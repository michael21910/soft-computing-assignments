# Soft Computing Assignments
Introduction to Soft Computing assignments in NDHU, senior.
There are 2 assignments in this repository.

The description of the problems are as follows:
* HW1: Write a C or MATLAB program to compute multiplication of two given interval matrices [A] and [B] by extending the basic multiplication of intervals.
* HW2: Please choose Exercise 4 or 5 (p.51, Concepts of Soft Computing) to generate the fuzzy set B on f(x1, x2, …, xr) = x1^2 + x2^2 + … + xr^2.  
The boundary of your program function is r = 2.  
Please include your codes and the results of execution in a file.
